MicroStudy
==========

MicroStudy was an idea I had to create a web application that would allow a user to study for exams little-by-little over time. The completed web app would allow the user to enter questions along with their answer and specify how and when they would be sent a practice question. This code is now unmaintained, but the general design of the backend and design patterns used is included.
